what is redis?(multi-model db)
(Remote dictionary DB)
In-memory Db which is stored in RAM.
often used as cache
it can be used as primary DB
it can be in multiple formats
it stores in key value

while creating large scale proj we need to have different types of db

but in redis it already has this alternatives and modules

redisearch - elastic search
redisgraph - graphql
redisjson - mongo

Advantages
* Faster(Faster run and test) Because its Schemaless Because whenever restarting test or  run redis memory empties
* Replica is used for not loosing data , Other methods
  1.Snapshots (few minutes only)
  2.append only file(more durable but slower)
  3. we can combine both
PS. Best practise is to separate persistent storage from disk storage


It's faster because it uses flask disks(ssd) The most used data will be stored on RAM and less used stored in ssd. which saves infrastructure costs

Scaling :
1.Clustering : Primary for read and write which can have multiple replica. So if one fails another can step up
2. Sharding : Subsets of Data i.e shards which have different operation. Re-sharding can give more shards

Using it in Kubernetes:

Because Redis is solely used for micro-services the main method for micro-services is kube. It's comman use cases

1.creating redis cluster
2. all redis operations like sharding , clustering , replicating and scaling is done by kube operators.
3. redis operator in kube is automates the deployment and config. also like scaling ,backups and recovery etc.
